		<h1>Your ultimate guide to London</h1>
		<h2>London restaurants and bars, films and theatre, art, gigs, clubs, shops and more...</h2>
		<p><img src="img/visitboy.png"/> London is one of the greatest cities in the world; rich in history, culture, fine cuisine, and shopping. However no trip to the great city would be complete without venturing into a London pub. Pub culture has been thriving in London for centuries, and in every style imaginable; from the dark, wooden pubs filled with boisterous workmen, to the genteel and elaborate Victorian pubs. Central London is a great place to have a pint, especially around West End and Covent Garden. For those who are more adventurous, head towards Farringdon Station and down the streets of Clerkenwell</p>

	<h1>Big Ben</h1>
	<p>One of the most iconic landmarks not only in London, but around the globe! Big Ben is the nickname for the bell in the clock tower at the end of the Houses of Parliament and for decades has remained an integral part of London’s heritage.</p>
	<h1>Buckingham Palace</h1>
	<p>Whether you are interested in British Royalty or think it’s an overhyped hypocrisy, the sight of the palace at the end of the Mall is pretty spectacular and well worth taking the time to experience.</p>
